Web application prototype for [quora](https://quora.com)-like application, that could post questions. But this repo is just the implementation of Machine Learning Systems that implement grammar corrector, question similiarity checker, and topic classification, and then saving the data into SQLite.

## ML Modules
-------

1. Linguistic Acceptability - Taufiq Husada
2. Question Similiarity - Naufal Prima Yoriko
3. Topic Classification - Fatkhan M

The training codes and data link are saved in `ml-train` directory, while prediction functions that used in backend and trained model links are saved in `backend/ml` directory.
